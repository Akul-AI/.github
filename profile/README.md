## Intro
Welcome to AkulAI! We aim to make the best open-source voice assistant out there! So, far, we have only made the voice assistant, but we do plan on making a framework for it so that you can easily integrate it into your own apps! It will also someday have its own apps and other addons to go along with it.

## Contribution
While we can't promise a paying job, we would love all the help we can get! If you want to help, pick a repo, make a pull request with whatever you want to do, and we will merge it if we think it is good! Contact us at akulgoelstudios@gmail.com to be a member of this organization!

Oh, and if you are a member, try to make yourself public. You deserve the credit.
