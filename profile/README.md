🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?

## Intro
Welcome to AkulAI! We aim to make the best open-source voice assistant out there! So, far, we have only made the voice assistant, but we do plan on making a framework for it so that you can easily integrate it into your own apps!

## Contribution
While we can't promise a paying job, we would love all the help we can get! If you want to help, pick a repo, make a pull request with whatever you want to do, and we will pull it if we think it is good! Contact me at akulgoel2010@gmail.com to be a member of this organization!
